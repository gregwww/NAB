Hi all,

Unfortunately I've got extremely limited Web development experience and my rusty knowledge in ASP area
(I've never claimed opposite) didn't allow me to produce anything worthy to submit for your assessment.

Thus, I'm submitting the code of c# WPF application, that's all I can do at the moment. 
I hope the app implements the specification (besides of ASP.NET related requirements of course).

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Greg
